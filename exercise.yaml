###                                 CLINTON             27_November_2022
    
    EXERCISE: 
        * Create two containers
        * One should be running ubuntu 20.04 and centos 7
        * Check the distribution, and which package manager each use 
        * Install the following  CLI editors Nano, Vi, Vim
        * What software center/software manager does it use
        * create a user with your name and give it admin rights
        * create another user and do not give it admin rights
    
    Solution:
      # In this exercise I will be using the docker desktop to run my containers
      - Chinking if docker desktop is up and runnig:
        *Click on the "show hidden icons" arrow on the taskbar and move your mouse pointer to highlight the docker Daemon to see if the docker desktop is running.
        *If docker is not running, you can manually start Docker by double-clicking on the docker icon on your desktop.

      # Create two containers
        To create || run a container, we need to make sure we have the image of the container that we want to build if it's stored locally in our system.
        To check if we already have the image in our local computer,:

            $ docker images

        If we don't have the image locally, download them by running this command:

            $ docker pull <image-name>

        In this exercise, I will be downloading two docker images ubuntu 20.04 & centos 7:
          Commands
            $ docker pull ununtu:20.04
            $ docker pull centos:7

        # Now that i have my images, I can start runnig my containers
          For ubuntu,:
            $ docker run -it --name clint -h ubuntu-1 ubuntu:20.04 bash
          For centos,:
            $ docker run -it --name fcc -h centos-1 centos:7 bash

        To exit a docker container,: use the exit command
            $ exit
        To stop a docker container,: use the stop command
            $ docker stop <container_name||ID>
        To start a docker container,: Use the start command
            $ docker start <container_name||ID>
        To login to a docker container,: run the following commad
            $ docker exec -it <container_name||ID> <the shell>

        # the parkage maneger for 
          ubuntu is : apt
          centos is : yum

        # how to install nano & vim on both containers
          for ubuntu,:
            $ apt update -y
            $ apt install sudo -y
            $ sudo apt update
            $ sudo apt install nano -y
            $ sudo apt update
            $ sudo apt install vim -y
          for centos,:
            $ yum update -y
            $ yum install sudo -y
            $ sudo yum update
            $ sudo yum install nano -y
            $ sudo yum update
            $ sudo yum install vim -y

        # create a user with your name and give it admin rights
          for Ubuntu,:
            $ sudo adduser clinton
              User passwd=<username>
        # Give clinton administrative rights,:
            Add a user to the sudoers file:
              # Open the visudo file in the text editor using the following command
            $ sudo visudo
              # The position where you see root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL is where we’re going to change our username.
              # Replace the root with “clinton” with the sudoers in my case. Insert the following lines in this file:.
              ---
              Root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL              
              clinton ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
              ---
              Save the file and exit.
              
            Adding Sudo User from Usermod Command:
            $ sudo usermod -aG sudo clinton

          for centos,:
            $ sudo adduser clinton
            $ passwd <newuser>=clinton
              User passwd=<username>
            giving clinton administrative rights:
                # in centos, the sudo=administrative group is wheel
            $ sudo usermod -aG wheel clinton

        # create another user and do not give it admin rights
          for Ubuntu,:
            $ sudo adduser nesa
              User passwd=<username>
          for Centos,:
            $ sudo adduser nesa
            $ passwd <newuser>=nesa
              User passwd=<username>

        To login as user into a docker containers:
            $ docker exec -it -u <username> <container_name||ID> <the shell>
            
        Practice Practice Practice till you get comfortable.:
